A.P. 1968 - Nordburg, the capital city of the Northern Republic - ...In the middle of Nordburg, there stood an Old-Patriarchal Church: a symbol of ancient-Monotheism from the past. After the division of the Church, people’s serve for this Church had decreased and it has since collapsed miserably. Nowadays surrounded by slums and dubious shops, almost no trace remained of the world's largest religious city it had once been...
...After finishing our prayers and work at the Church, Hal and I walked out of town and headed towards a hillside park where we would have a great view of the city at night.
After talking like usual about what we had done at work, I took two cigarettes and a cheap blue lighter out of my bag and started smoking. A half-broken street lamp illuminated the area in a pale gray hue.

'...Are you still smoking? Hal asked me uncomfortably, but with a faint smile.'
'Well... I can't stop it.'
I slightly hesitated before answering her question. 'Alexei said that we should stop smoking - '
While Hal said this, I began inhaling from the cigarette. The smoke ran through my body and gave me a pleasant and warm feeling. It spread throughout my lungs and when I took a breath again, it went out like vapor.
'...Devout believers should purify the body and soul ...When we interpret this verse, it means that orthodox believers should not drink alcohol or smoke.'
'...I know that.'
Hal tries to make eye contact, but I look away from her and fixate my gaze on the tip of my cigarette.
'I just can't stand all of this without being able to smoke... I am enslaved with low wages and won’t be able to buy a car or a house even if I work for 5 or 10 years! So...'
So I taste the cigarette again and inhale the smoke. 
'...I just start smoking out of desperation.' →'I just disappointed. That's why I start smoking out of desperation.'
'That's not true!'→'That's not true! You can change from now on, Nicolas.'
She puts her hands together in front of her chest. It’s her prayer pose.
'You came back here while everyone in this country forgot Orthodox theism. I'm sure that God blesses you.'
'...But what about now? I’m doing things against theism here. 'But your faith is true, right?'

'Well, my faith is... I try to finish my response but eventually decide to hold it in. It’s better not telling Hal. 'I hate them!' 'Make me more powerful!' That’s what I’m thinking while singing hymns: 'I was born to love'...'
...We dropped the topic of religion and started talking about my old smoking habit again.
'...How do you feel when you smoke?'
'She whispered her question to me.'
'...First of all, my body gets quite warm. After that, the entire world turns beautiful.'
'That streetlight over there, the blue night sky, the vegetation of this park and even the pavement...'
'...They all get such vibrant colors, you know?'
'...If you say so, I might want to see that too.
Wait, that's no good! I can’t accept Hal taking up smoking and cutting her life short...
'Well apart from that, nothing good comes from smoking! It hurts your lungs and you’ll feel sick if you run out of cigarettes... My friend says the same: 'There's only harm in it, nothing good at all!!', haha...'
'...If you say so, Nicolas.'

...Hal’s face started to seem a bit blurry. Her light beige hair blended in with her sea-blue eyes. I assumed the Nicotine was starting to affect my vision and head...
'...There is another reason not to smoke, Hal. Look at this pack of cigarettes...'
There’s an advertisement on the packaging, with the letters written in white-impact font on a black gradient background. The advertising phrase is surrounded by large double quotes and sounds as if it’s reading out some official-looking political speech. It's written in the southern language of this country which I can barely pronounce. But I know what it says since this verse is from my favorite thinker's book.
''Death is the possibility that all beings become impossible.' Well... basicaly that means 'Smoking significantly shortens your lifespan.'But... I like how it sounds.
...It’s also written in our northern language on the backside with small letters. Hal listened to me silently, with a curious expression.
''People who smoke often are 18 times more likely to have lung cancer than nonsmokers'. In short, 'Only courageous people who are ready to die should consider smoking! It’s your own responsibility!''
'But that's...'
She looks puzzled.
'So, while I'm smoking, I can get back to my duty... by taking risk of dying. Stupid, isn’t it??'
'...And I can't live without it.'
Suddenly, I felt sad and started to cry. If I don't smoke, I can’t cope with my life... And i’m shortening my own life while being ridiculed by such stupid propaganda. After all, I'm dominated by the people selling this. I’ve thought about that.'

'...Nicolas?
I cried quietly and tried to muffle my voice from leaving my mouth. From my eyes, tears overflow and drip down both of my cheeks.
'I'm sorry... I shouldn't have talked about that.'
'...Maybe the person who came up this slogan wanted everyone who held this pack of cigarettes to have a long life?'
'... Why do you think so?'
I asked Hal.
'Rather than smoking and shortening your life... They hope you remember these words at times where you feel life is being difficult.'
'As encouragement, to live strong instead!'
'...To live strong?'
I thought. That's right ...I was only thinking about this advertisement to make it convenient for me. I was desperate and thought, 'I can die!' And thought too:'I can think like that, so I'm a great person!' But in fact, I couldn’t deal with what I thought about Hal and my current work even thought so, in the end...
'I want you to live long... Nicolas.'
She said, as she looked at me with her eyes shining brightly.
'I want you to live long too, Hal. I replied.'
...And I want to add 'because I love you', but I just don't have the courage to say it right now...


...After our conversation, we headed back into the big city and parted ways. It was almost midnight already. I went to the house where my family was waiting, while Hal returned to the Church under the blessing of God.

'Anna will surely be worried about me' I thought. It seems that after a long time, I was now finally able to consider my family’s feelings too, instead of only my own. This is... probably thanks to Hal.

My heart is now filled with the words 'Because I love you', not the pale smoke of cigarettes.
